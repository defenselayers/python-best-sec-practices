## Purpose of the document
At [Defenselayers](https://defenselayers.com) we are dedicated to enable you to design, develop and deploy secure and
compliant applications. While [Python](https://www.python.org/) is a great and fun language it still requires some 
knowledge to write secure code using it. At our company we also believe that knowledge sharing is a fundament of 
any successful _cybersecurity_ program. Use our best practices not only to your advantage but please share those with
other developers. We hope you will learn something from us and others will learn from you.
